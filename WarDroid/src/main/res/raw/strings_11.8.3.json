The war was over unless we found a new way. In our desperation we turned to the Void. The blinding night, the hellspace where our science and reason failed.\r\n\r\nWe took the twisted few that had returned from that place. We built a frame around them, a conduit of their affliction. Gave them the weapons of the old ways. Gun and blade. A new warrior, a new code was born. These rejects, these Tenno, became our saviors.

Across all our worlds, all at once, the ceremonial Naga drums. A royal salute to the honored Tenno. Ten solemn beats to declare the suffering was over. I watched from a distance, with the rest of the low Guardians. With each beat terror began to crush my throat. The Tenno were not stoic and silent. They were waiting. They were poised. I tried to call out but only a strangled whisper escaped.\r\n\r\nWhen the ninth beat rang a torrent of blood filled the stadium, loosed by Tenno blades. The drums, the Empire, fell silent forever.\r\n\r\nNow I hunt, dividing your numbers. Watching from that dark place, cataloging your sins, I am the ghost of retribution.

All you need to do is sneak onto this ship and take care of a something for me. Nothing major, I know you can handle the work. I'll explain when you're on board. \r\n\r\nWhat do you say, will you help your old friend Darvo out?\r\n\r\nOh and by the way, I'd appreciate it if you keep this between you and me.

Courtesy of your hard work I have a very special bundle for you. A Nekros Warframe, the Carrier Sentinel, a Soma rifle and the ever deadly Ether Reaper. All at half the usual market prices.

We have tried to work within the forests, we have tried to tame the forests, our capitulation has become weakness. \r\n\r\nThe Cicero Toxin will break these forests and impose our will on the landscape.

We will not let this happen.\r\n\r\nYou need to find an antidote to this toxin. I believe the key ingredients lie within the very forests the Grineer want to destroy.
